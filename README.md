# Usefuel Stats
Here we compiled a bunch of usefuel resorces to introduce folks into different statistical methods. Depending on the data type or specific requirement there are different metods available. We trey to include resorces that provide a good introdution to the data analysis that might be more friedly that the traditional statiscis text books. Hoever, if folks required a deep undestanding of an specifi approch we recoment to go to those although sometimes that might be painfuel (no worries, we know that!).

We organize this repository by data type and the assumtion that doesn't met. We'll try to update the list of resources as . Also, if there are sources that you find usefuel and you consider that should be included.
